# amazon-alexa

A practice R and, in contrast, subsequent Jupyter notebook which utilizes a dataset of Amazon Alexa reviews. The purpose of the practice was
to build a random forest (collection of trees) model which, given just the text data of an Amazon Alexa review, can accurately 
predict its rating. (i.e. 4 stars)
